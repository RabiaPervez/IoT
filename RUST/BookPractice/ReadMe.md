This repository folder has been dedicated to practice code from the Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ . </br>
To get started in Rust, //
1- Download rust from rust-lang.org //
2- to check the version use rustc --version or write cargo in terminal to see if it is available

3- open vscode
4- then install extensions (rust analyzer and rust extension pack)
5- make program main.rs and write this prog in it
fn main() {
println!("Hello world");
}


6- now go in terminal and type rustc main.rs
7- 2 files will be generated, i.e., main.exe and main.pdb
8- now use .\main.exe to execute the file


Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.
