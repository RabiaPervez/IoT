This repository folder has been dedicated to practice code from the Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ . </br>
To get started in Rust, </br>
1- Download rust from rust-lang.org </br>
2- to check the version use rustc --version or write cargo in terminal to see if it is available </br>

3- open vscode </br>
4- then install extensions (rust analyzer and rust extension pack) </br>
5- make program main.rs and write this prog in it </br>
fn main() { </br>
println!("Hello world"); </br>
} </br>


6- now go in terminal and type rustc main.rs </br>
7- 2 files will be generated, i.e., main.exe and main.pdb </br>
8- now use .\main.exe to execute the file </br>


Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.</br>

*** Another way to get started </br>
1- make a working folder, e.g., named "work" </br>
2- go into the folder and type in terminal "cargo init" </br>
3- main.rs will be created in folder of src </br>
4- to run the main.rs, type cargo run </br>
5- to make a new folder in the workinf directory, the command "cargo new <folder name>" can be used.
